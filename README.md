Project Name: Chitter Challenge
Week 4 - Makers Academy
=================

* Challenge time: rest of the day and weekend, until Monday 9am
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Challenge:
-------

Write a little Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Features:
-------

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made


Notes on functionality:
---------------------

This is a web application that is designed to be a replica of twitter. A user can register, view 'peeps' (equivalent of 'tweets'), log_in, write their own 'peeps' and log_out. When users register, their password is encrypted and all information is stored on the database. Peeps are displayed in reverse chronological order and with the time they were submitted.

Installation and example use:
----------------------------

$ git clone https://github.com/douglasrose/chitter-challenge.git
$ cd chitter-challenge
$ bundle install
$ ruby app/app.rb

navigate to http://localhost:4567/ on browser.


<!-- Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the css to make it look good (we all like beautiful things).

Good luck and let the chitter begin!

Code Review
-----------

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend. -->

Notes on test coverage
----------------------

Please ensure you have the following **AT THE TOP** of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:

```ruby
require 'coveralls'
require 'simplecov'

SimpleCov.formatters = [
  SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
  Coveralls::SimpleCov::Formatter
]
Coveralls.wear!
```

You can see your [test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) when you submit a pull request, and you can also get a summary locally by running:

```
$ coveralls report
```

This repo works with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) to calculate test coverage statistics on each pull request.
